                <h3>Welcome to the Game Bunker!</h3>

                <p>
                    This is my first portfolio project and I wanted to display as much as my skills 
                    as possible. I've created this little project to show off some of my web development 
                    and game development skills. I've decided to show of my game dev projects because it 
                    is a hobby of mine and I've always wanted to try to pursue it as a career or if I get 
                    lucky publish an indy game on my own and make a few bucks. I've never had many people 
                    try any of my games so this is also a chance to get some feedback on what I can improve 
                    upon and hopefully come out with the next best thing!

                    Sumo Ball is a 3rd person pinball like game. The objective of the game is to bush as many of the white pinballs
                    off of the platform as you can. The game is over when you fall or are knocked off of the platform. Use the 'W' and 'S'
                    keys to move the ball forwards and backwards. Use the 'A' and 'D' keys to rotate the platform to the direction you want
                    to move. This is the first game I created using the Unity3D engine and it is based off of the game used in the Unity
                    Learn website with a few adjustments on my part. You can play this game by either clicking on the picture above or
                    by clicking <a href="https://play.unity.com/mg/other/sumo-ball-15" target="_blank" style="color: greenyellow">here!</a>.

                    Dine and Dash is a 3rd person side scroller. The objective is to jump over as many boxes as you can without running int
                    them. The game is over if you crash into one of the boxes. Use the spacebar to jump over the boxes. This is another game
